## Development Environment Setup

To contribute to this project or set up a local development environment, follow these steps to install dependencies and prepare your environment.

### Prerequisites

* Ensure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your system (preferably version 3.8 or later).
* [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is required for dependency management. Poetry simplifies packaging and simplifies the management of Python dependencies.
* One of the python dependencies [QuickLZ](https://pypi.org/project/pyquicklz/) will be compiled by Poetry when installed. Ensure that you have a compiler that Poetry/Pip can use and the Python headers. On a debian based Linux system this can be accomplished with `sudo apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential`. On Windows installation of (just) the Visual C++ 14.x compiler is required, this can be accomplished with [MSBuild tools package](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_BuildTools.exe).
* [Squashfs-tools](https://github.com/plougher/squashfs-tools) is required if building Linux AppImages. On Debian based systems it's provided by the package `squashfs-tools`. This is only required if packaging for linux.
* [linuxdeploy](https://github.com/linuxdeploy/linuxdeploy) is required for building Linux AppImages. These must be installed and available in your PATH before building. You can install them using `scripts/install_linux_prereqs.sh` or by following the instructions on their GitHub page.
* [gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) is required for language file generation. [gettext-iconv-windows](https://mlocati.github.io/articles/gettext-iconv-windows.html) project has a version with Windows packages.
* For building iOS app, you need a working XCode installation as well as the build tool that can be installed with `brew install autoconf automake libtool pkg-config`
* Building the Android app needs a Linux host. The prerequisites can be found here: [buildozer prerequisites](https://buildozer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html). A script to install them is provided in `scripts/install_android_prereqs.sh`. Be aware that buildozer downloads/installs multiple GB of Android development tooling.

### Installing Poetry

Follow the official installation instructions to install Poetry. The simplest method is via the command line:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

or on Windows:

```bash
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | py -
```

Once installed, make sure Poetry is in your system's PATH so you can run it from any terminal window. Verify the installation by checking the version:

```bash
poetry --version
```

### Setting Up the Development Environment

Once you have Poetry installed, setting up the development environment is straightforward:

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Carvera-Community/CarveraController.git
   ```

2. **Install the project dependencies**

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

   On Windows the ios-dev dependencies cannot be satisfied, so instead you need to run: `poetry install --without ios-dev`

   This command will create a virtual environment (if one doesn't already exist) and install all required dependencies as specified in the `pyproject.toml` file.

3. **Activate the virtual environment** (optional, but useful for running scripts directly)

   ```bash
   poetry env activate
   ```

   This step is usually not necessary since `poetry run <command>` automatically uses the virtual environment, but it can be helpful if you want to run multiple commands without prefixing `poetry run`.

### Running the Project

You can run the Controller software using Poetry's run command without installation. This is handy for iterative development.

```bash
poetry run python -m carveracontroller
```

To run the iOS app, you first need to build its dependencies using the Local Packaging instructions below. The build script will open Xcode for you, or you can open the project manually by finding it in `assets/packaging/ios/carveracontroller-ios`.

### Quality Checks

The project uses [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) (linting), [Mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/) (type checking), [import-linter](https://import-linter.readthedocs.io/) (architectural boundaries), and pytest for the repeatable quality gate. Ruff covers application code, tests, and project-owned Python scripts with rules for syntax/name errors, imports, bug-prone patterns, return consistency, comprehensions, and Python-version-aware modernization. Mypy checks the controller application and shared package modules with core type/name/attribute/call errors enabled, and runs a separate strict check for `carveracontroller/machine/`. Addon packages are linted and tested; package-level mypy does not include them because their Kivy plugin surfaces rely heavily on runtime-bound ids and controller objects. import-linter checks package architecture, including the rule that `machine` stays Kivy-free.

Run all configured hooks with pre-commit:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```

To run the same checks automatically on every `git commit`, install the hooks once:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit install
```

Run individual checks with Poetry:

```bash
poetry run ruff check carveracontroller tests scripts
poetry run ruff format --check carveracontroller tests scripts
poetry run mypy carveracontroller --config-file pyproject.toml
poetry run mypy carveracontroller/machine --config-file pyproject.toml --strict
poetry run lint-imports --config pyproject.toml
poetry run python -m pytest tests -q
```

To format checked Python files, run:

```bash
poetry run ruff format carveracontroller tests scripts
```

### Local Packaging

The application is packaged using PyInstaller (except for iOS). This tool converts Python applications into a standalone executable, so it can be run on systems without requiring management of a installed Python interpreter or dependent libraries. An build helper script is configured with Poetry and can be run with:

```bash
poetry run python scripts/build.py --os os --version version [--no-appimage]
```

The options for `os` are windows, macos, linux, pypi, ios or android. If selecting `linux`, an appimage is built by default unless --no-appimage is specified.
For iOS, the project will be open in XCode and needs to be built from there to simplify the signing process.

The value of `version` should be in the format of X.Y.Z e.g., 1.2.3 or v1.2.3.

### Setting up translations

The Carvera Controller UI natively uses the English language, but is capable of displaying other languages as well. Today only English and Simplified Chinese is supported. UI Translations are made using the string mapping file `carveracontroller/locales/messages.pot` and the individual language strings are stored in `carveracontroller/locales/{lang}}/LC_MESSAGES/{lang}.po`. During build the `.po` files are compiled into a binary `.mo` file using the *msgfmt* utility.

If you add or modify any UI text strings you need to update the messages.pot file and individual .po files to account for it. This way translators can help add translations for the new string in the respective .po language files.

Updating the .pot and .po strings, as well as compiling to .mo can be performed by running the following command:

``` bash
poetry run python scripts/update_translations.py
```

This utility scans the python and kivvy code for new strings and updates the mapping files. It does not clear/overwrite previous translations.

### Collected Data & Privacy

See [the privacy page](PRIVACY.md) for more details.

### Adaptive roughing telemetry (experimental shadow mode)

Enter `adaptive monitor` in the MDI console to open live RPM and PWM traces,
telemetry age, baseline-relative RPM droop, and a proposed feed override. These
are local controller commands: they are never forwarded to firmware. The
monitor runs in the connection-owning process and records JSONL telemetry in
`$KIVY_HOME/adaptive` (normally `~/.kivy/adaptive`).

`adaptive baseline` arms a five-second baseline capture. Capture requires a
stationary machine in Idle, zero feed, and a spindle already near commanded
speed. The operator must ensure the tool is unloaded; telemetry cannot prove
that. This command does not start the spindle. `adaptive reset` discards the
baseline; `adaptive off`, `adaptive shadow`, and `adaptive status` control or
inspect the monitor. Reconnecting discards the baseline.

Feed proposals are experimental: filtered baseline-relative droop above 1.2%
or PWM saturation reduces the simulated override in 10-point steps; recovery
below 0.4% is slower, in 2-point steps. Proposals stay between 40% and 100%.
Missing PWM is unknown. Stale/invalid telemetry and severe droop latch a shadow
fault until reset or fresh baseline capture. No adaptation is evaluated outside
Run with positive feed. RPM and PWM indicate spindle behavior, not a calibrated
contact sensor or motor torque measurement.

**This build cannot apply adaptive feed changes or issue an adaptive hold.**
The live monitor is for qualification before enabling an actuator path. Status
polling remains 200 ms; a faster UI does not establish faster machine telemetry.
Active override timing, fault response, and cutting-load calibration still
require qualification on the intended machine and toolpath.
